# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Arduino-and-Gloves
This project is mainly for detecting Sign Language using a glove which is programmed using Arduino.

List of Components:
1) Arduino Uno 
2) 5 flex sensors
3) 47K Resistors (5 Resistors)
4) Male and female wires
5) Long Wires
6) Glove 


Components Explanation:

Arduino Uno: It is the board where all components are connected to it, we can consider it as the brain of everything, can be programed to do functions depends on what we need. 
Flex Sensors: It is the sensors that detect the bend and increase and decrease the resistance depending on whether its bended or not. 

47K Resistors: It is attached to every flex in our circuit and each resistor has its own value which is 47000 and we use this value and define it in the code.

Wires: Used to attach all components together.
